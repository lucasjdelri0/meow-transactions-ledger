# Meow Challenge

This project is intended to solve the frontend challenge proposed by Meow.

The project was created with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) by [Lucas Del Rio](https://github.com/lucasjdelri0).

## Solution

### Features

Basically, you will be able to check your categories (accounts), keep track of their balance, and transfer money between them.

Main Features:

- List all categories sorted by their balance in descending order
- Transfer money from one category to another
- Keep track of the transactions history in each category

> NOTES:
>
> Some categories and transactions were hardcoded in order to have a starting point for the application. You will find them in the `categories.tsx` file.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `yarn lint`

Instructs ESLint to identify and try to fix as many issues as possible in .js, .jsx, .ts, and .tsx files.

### `yarn format:check`

Check if your files are formatted to the intended Prettier config, and get a list of the unformatted files, if any.

### `yarn format:write`

Format all your files to the intended Prettier config.

> NOTES:
>
> Use .eslintignore and .prettierignore to ignore files that should not be analyzed and/or formatted

## Vercel Deployment

You can access a production deployment in [Vercel](https://meow-transactions-ledger.vercel.app/) for a quick testing.
